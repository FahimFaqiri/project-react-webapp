# responsive-website-react

* In this project i will create a fully responsive website with react hooks and routing, making good use of the REACT icons library. The webpage will contain dynamic pages created javascript every component will have dynamic info and so it is completely reusable. 

* The code is supposed to produce a full fledged website containing some dummy text, showcasing my ability to handle REACT js.

The libraries used for this project are 
* REACT
-> REACT icons library
-> REACT router library

* My vision for this project is to use it as my base template for my future online webstore.

* This project is almost completed, im still only missing the proper linking to different sections of the project but this will be implemented soon. If you wanna check out this project then click the link! *** https://angry-rosalind-9ae72b.netlify.app ***
