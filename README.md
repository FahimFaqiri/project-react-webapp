# responsive-website-react

* In this project i will create a fully responsive website with react hooks and routing, making good use of the REACT icons library. The webpage will contain dynamic pages created javascript every component will have dynamic info and so it is completely reusable. 

* The code is supposed to produce a full fledged website containing some dummy text, showcasing my ability to handle REACT js.

The libraries used for this project are 
* REACT
-> REACT icons library
-> REACT router library

* My vision for this project is to use it as my base template for my future online webstore.

* This project is completed the main components are created, the dynamic effect is in place. And the footer and navbar are also done if you want to check out this project click on the link! *** https://angry-rosalind-9ae72b.netlify.app ***
